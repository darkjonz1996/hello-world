Intro to Git

Hello there,

I am Jonah De Lima, you can call me Jonz, I am currently a College student but I can work as a newbie Web Developer, a Front-end Developer currently learning Back-end Development so that it makes me a Full-Stack Developer, I know how to structure webs on HTML then design it on CSS and then "program" it on Javascript, I know one of the most famous JS Library called JQuery, and some other Web useful libraries like howler.js and paper.js. I am currently have no experience in work so I would gladly volunteer on open projects. My goal in life is to become a professional IT/CS expert and maybe get great promotion in my future job.
